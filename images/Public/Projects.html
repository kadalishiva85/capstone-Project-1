        <b><li>AI-Based Fraud Detection System</li></b>
        <p>
            <b>Description:</b> This project aims to detect fraudulent activities in various domains, such as financial transactions and online payments, using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies, the model can flag suspicious activities in real time. Fraud detection systems are essential for financial institutions and e-commerce platforms to minimize losses due to fraud and ensure customer trust

        <b><li>Dark Side of the Web: Dark Web Classification Based on TextCNN and Topic Modelling Weight </li></b>
        <p>
            <b>Description:</b> Currently developing a model to classify cyber threat content on the Dark Web by integrating topic modeling with TextCNN. The approach focuses on extracting key topics to reduce text data complexity and improve classification accuracy. Initial results show promising improvements over traditional text classification methods.
